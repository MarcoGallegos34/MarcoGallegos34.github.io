      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <title>Multi-level multi-state modelling applied to hospital admission in mexican patients with COVID-19</title>

      <description>Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic, healthcare authorities have made clear that it is crucial to track and identify COVID-19 symptoms and seek medical attention in the presence of the first warning signs, as immediate medical attention can improve the patient’s prognosis. Therefore the present work aims to analyze the risks associated with the time between the patient’s first symptoms and hospitalization followed by death. A cross-sectional study was performed among Mexican population diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized from March to January 2021.</description>

      <title>A multi-dimensional non-homogeneous Markov chain of order K to jointly study multi-pollutant exceedances</title>

      <description>In this work we consider a multivariate non-homogeneous Markov chain of order K &amp;gt; 0 to study the occurrences of exceedances of environmental thresholds. In the model, d &amp;gt; 0 pollutants may be followed and according to their respective environmental thresholds a daily measurement may be considered an exceedance or not. The parameters of the model are the order of the chain, and its initial and transition distributions. These parameters are estimated under the Bayesian point of view.</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>
